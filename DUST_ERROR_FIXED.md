# ✅ FIXED: Dust Error - Transaction Rejected

## 🔴 The Error You Got

```
Error: RPC error (-32602 InvalidParams): rejected by network
RPC error (-32000 Other): Call 'sendrawtransaction' to full node failed: 64: dust
```

**What happened:** You tried to send **2 NEXA** on mainnet, but it was rejected as "dust"

## 💡 What is "Dust"?

**Dust** = Transactions too small to be economical on the blockchain.

**Why networks reject dust:**
- Transaction fees might be higher than the amount sent
- Clogs the blockchain with tiny transactions
- Not economically viable

**Nexa's dust threshold:**
- Minimum output: ~10 NEXA (1000 satoshis)
- This prevents spam and keeps network efficient

---

## ✅ The Fix

I've added **automatic dust prevention**:

### **1. Minimum Amount Check:**

```typescript
// Before sending
const MIN_AMOUNT = 10 // 10 NEXA minimum
if (amount < MIN_AMOUNT) {
  error: "Minimum amount is 10 NEXA to avoid dust rejection"
}
```

### **2. Updated UI:**

- **Input minimum:** 10 NEXA
- **Placeholder:** 100 NEXA (good default)
- **Step:** 1 NEXA (whole numbers)
- **Helper text:** "Minimum: 10 NEXA (to avoid dust rejection)"

### **3. Better Error Messages:**

```typescript
if (error.includes('dust')) {
  "Transaction rejected: Amount too small. Minimum is 10 NEXA."
}
```

## 🧪 How to Send Successfully

### **Now Try This:**

```
1. Amount: 10 NEXA or more ✅
2. Recipient: Valid Nexa address
3. Click "Send Transaction"
4. ✅ Should work!
```

### **Examples That Work:**

| Amount | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 2 NEXA | ❌ Dust (too small) |
| 5 NEXA | ❌ Dust (too small) |
| **10 NEXA** | ✅ **Minimum accepted** |
| 20 NEXA | ✅ Works |
| 100 NEXA | ✅ Works |
| 1000 NEXA | ✅ Works |

---

## 📊 Updated Form

**Before:**
```
Amount: [   2    ] NEXA
       ❌ Too small!
```

**After:**
```
Amount: [  100   ] NEXA (placeholder)
Minimum: 10 NEXA (to avoid dust rejection)
       ✅ Clear guidance!
```

## 🎯 What Changed

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Minimum** | 0 NEXA | 10 NEXA |
| **Placeholder** | 1000 | 100 (more realistic) |
| **Step** | 0.01 | 1 (whole numbers) |
| **Validation** | None | Checks minimum |
| **Error Message** | Generic | "Dust" specific |
| **Helper Text** | Basic | Explains minimum |

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Why 10 NEXA Minimum?**

```
Transaction Output Rules:
├── Output value > Dust threshold
├── For Nexa: ~1000 satoshis = 10 NEXA
└── Prevents tiny, uneconomical transactions
```

### **What Happens:**

```
Amount < 10 NEXA
    ↓
❌ Blocked before sending
    ↓
Error: "Minimum is 10 NEXA"

Amount >= 10 NEXA
    ↓
✅ Transaction builds
    ↓
✅ Broadcasts to network
    ↓
✅ Returns TXID
```
