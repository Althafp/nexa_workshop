  - Amount validation
  - Dust prevention (10 NEXA minimum)
  - Success/error handling
  - Explorer link integration

### ✅ Step 8: Test Your DApp
Comprehensive testing checklist:
1. Generate wallet verification
2. Import wallet (cross-wallet compatibility test)
3. Get testnet NEXA (faucet options)
4. Send transaction end-to-end
5. Verify compatibility with Wally/Otoplo
