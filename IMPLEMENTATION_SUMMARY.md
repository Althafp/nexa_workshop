### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Technologies Used:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Lucide Icons

**Key Components:**
1. **WalletManager**: Handles wallet creation, import, and display
2. **SimpleTransfer**: Transaction building and execution interface
3. **WorkshopPreview**: Landing page preview section
4. **Project Pages**: Step-by-step tutorial layouts

**Mock Data:**
- Simulated wallet generation (for demo purposes)
- Mock transaction execution
- Testnet addresses simulation
- Transaction history mock data

### 📚 Educational Content

**Project 1 Contract:**
```nexscript
pragma nexscript ^0.1.0;

contract TransferWithTimeout(
  pubkey sender, 
  pubkey recipient, 
  int timeout
) {
  function transfer(sig recipientSig) {
    require(checkSig(recipientSig, recipient));
  }

  function timeout(sig senderSig) {
    require(checkSig(senderSig, sender));
    require(tx.time >= timeout);
  }
}
```

**Project 2 Contract:**
```nexscript
pragma nexscript ^0.1.0;

contract P2PKT(bytes20 pkh) {
  function spend(pubkey pk, sig s) {
    require(hash160(pk) == pkh);
    require(checkSig(s, pk));
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

Students will learn:
1. ✅ NexScript syntax and structure
2. ✅ Smart contract parameters and functions
3. ✅ Cryptographic operations (signatures, hashing)
4. ✅ Time-based constraints
5. ✅ Contract compilation
6. ✅ JavaScript SDK integration
7. ✅ Transaction building and sending
8. ✅ Wallet management basics

### 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the workshop:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Start Workshop"

3. **Choose a project:**
   - Start with Project 1 (recommended for beginners)
   - Or jump to Project 2

4. **Follow the steps:**
   - Each project has 5 clear steps
   - Code examples are provided
   - Explanations for each concept

5. **Test in playground:**
   - Click "Test in Playground" button

### 🔐 Security Notes

**Important:** This is a DEMO/EDUCATIONAL implementation:
- Mock wallet generation (not cryptographically secure)
- Simulated transactions (no real blockchain interaction)
- For production, use proper key generation libraries
- Never expose private keys in production

Recommended additions:
1. Real testnet integration with ElectrumNetworkProvider
2. Actual contract deployment interface
3. Interactive code editor with live compilation
4. Video walkthroughs for each project
5. Quizzes and knowledge checks
6. Student progress tracking
7. More advanced projects (escrow, DAO, etc.)
8. Real-time blockchain explorer integration
9. Proper cryptographic key generation
10. Multi-signature examples
